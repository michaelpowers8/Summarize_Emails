# Summarize_Emails Using ChatGPT

This program leverages locally downloadable GPT models from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search) to read and summarize email content. Summaries are saved to individual text files, with each file containing:

- A prompt given to the AI model
- The original email text (excluding attachments and sender/recipient data)
- The generation time for the AI response
- The full AI-generated summary

---

## Processing Logic

The system iterates through all emails previously marked as *Actionable*. These are prioritized based on the number of actionable phrases detected within their content.

The current setup handles ~30,000 actionable emails. With an average processing time of 45 seconds per email, full completion takes approximately 16 days of continuous runtime.
